# YelpCampBasics
A yelp-like app (with basic crud functionality so far) from Web Dev Course by Colt Steele

The App requires Node.js and a running MongoDB database, where the randomized data is seeded using seeds.js
+ all of the required packages in package.json installed with NPM

The App will improve via 
Authorization , 
Error Validations, 
Cookies, 
Sessions, 
More styling 
Followed by an interactive map
